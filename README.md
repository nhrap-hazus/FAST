# Hazus Flood Assessment Structure Tool

The Hazus Flood Assessment Structure Tool (FAST) calculates building-level flood impacts with user-provided building and flood depth data. FAST uses the Hazus Flood model methodology to assign depth damage functions to buildings according to their occupancy type, first floor elevation, foundation type, and number of stories. Flood depth is then extracted at every building and used as a depth damage function parameter to calculate flood losses in dollars. Flood-generated debris is estimated using building area in square feet. For more information about how FAST cacluates flood impacts, please refer to the Hazus Flood Technical Manual: https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1820-25045-8292/hzmh2_1_fl_tm.pdf

Building data must be formatted as a .csv file according to the specifications outlined here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTBuildingData.pdf Flood depth data must be formatted as a .tiff raster. Sample building data for Honolulu, HI are included in the "UDF" folder.

FAST is developed using the Hazus Python Package, HazPy. HazPy tools automatically check for updates each time they are opened. Hazus Python Package documentation is found here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/hazus. The Hazus Team would like to thank the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries for developing an early version of this tool: https://www.oregongeology.org/pubs/ofr/O-18-04/O-18-04_user_guide.pdf

## Requirements

The Flood Assessment Structure Tool requires Anaconda to be installed on your computer. Anaconda is a free software that automatically manages all Python packages required to run Hazus open source tools - including the Hazus Python package: https://fema-nhrap.s3.amazonaws.com/Hazus/Python/build/html/index.html

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Download Anaconda for Python 3

3. Complete the installation. During installation, make sure the following options are checked:

   - [x] Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable
   - [x] Register Anaconda as my default Python
   - [x] Install Anaconda for local user, rather than all users
   
FAST will automatically check for HazPy updates each time it is opened. If you experience errors during this process, please try uninstalling Anaconda and reinstalling the latest version.

## To Use

Follow the steps below to run FAST. To ensure .py files run when double-clicked, right-click the .py file and go to Properties. Under the "General" tab next to "Opens With", make sure "python.exe" is selected. If not, click "Change" and select "python.exe" from your Python installation directory.

**1. Download zip folder from GitHub, unzip. Rename unzipped folder from "FAST-master" to "FAST".**

**2. Place your formatted building data in the "UDF" subfolder. Place your flood depth data in the "Rasters" subfolder.
Guidance for formatting building data can be found here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTBuildingData.pdf***

**3. Double-click "FAST.py" If you don't have the Hazus Python Library installed, follow the prompt to install, then double-click "FAST.py" again.**

To review the default assignment of damage functions to each building type prior to running FAST, double-click "FAST-Preprocessing.py" and supply your building data. To customize the damage functions used by FAST to calculate losses, review these guidelines: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTDamageFunctions.pdf

![Open FAST](Images/Step3.png "Open FAST")

**4. Click "Browse to Inventory Input (.csv)" to select your formatted building data.**

![Supply building data](Images/Step4.png "Supply building data")

**5. Select "Riverine", "CoastalA", or "CoastalV" from the "Coastal Flooding Attribute" window according to your analysis requirements. Select a flood depth dataset from the "Depth Grid" window.**
