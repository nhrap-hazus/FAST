# CITATION TITLE: Open-File Report O-18-04, ArcGIS Python Script Alternative to the Hazus-MH Flood Model for User-Defined Facilities
# CITATION ORIGINATOR:  John M. Bauer, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries,
# 800 NE Oregon Street, Suite 965, Portland, OR 97232
# Downloadable at  http://www.oregongeology.org/pubs/ofr/p-O-18-04.htm
# 
#Description:
# Intended as a complement to the Hazus-MH Flood model. By using the Depth Damage Functions (DDF)
# exported from Hazus (methods described elsewhere), we calculate the damage calculations entirely outside
# of Hazus. Basic flow:
#    For each flood depth grid specified by the user:
#        Determine depth of flooding at the UDF point.
#        Process, record-by-record:
#            building/content/inventory damage based on the adjusted flood depth, the type of building, using the look-up tables.
#             Using the building loss ratio, calculates debris and building repair time.
#
#
# Script is intended for users with 'many' flood depth grids generated independently of Hazus-MH Flood,
# and a Hazus-compatible UDF pointfile. Please credit DOGAMI if code is used in whole or in part.
#
# The script's version number is decoupled from the Hazus-MH release version.
#
# The script requires two look-up libraries each, for Building, Content, and Inventory:
#     * One for the default situation, where the user supplies OccupancyClass, FoundationType, and NumStories but not a DDF ID
#    * One for the full library, where the user has some very specific DDF they wish to employ.
#
# Note this script does not replace all of Hazus-MH Flood functionality - it only replaces the UDF-based estimate.
#
#
# Revision History
#    20160502 v1.0 Initial Version
#    20160720 v2.0 Support for Content added. Support for user-supplied DDFs for Building and Content added.
#            Support for Coastal flooding added.
#    20160823 v2.1  Changed the inputs to be interactive. User specifies the pathnames, etc. Can be GUI'd
#            into an ArcToolBox.
#    20170331 v3.0  Extensive modification to structure, to conform to more maintainable coding styles,
#            based expert feedback:
#                Use Hazus convention for parameter Input/Output names.
#                 Added support for ArcToolBox so that the DDF library is at a default location and not hard-coded.
#            Fixed a Content Loss computation bug when user supplied their own Content Loss.
#            Added support for calculating Inventory Loss (and uncovered Hazus implementation bug).
#    20170630 v3.1
#        Debris support added.
#        Blanks for user-supplied DDFIDs are supported - they are treated as Null, and default DDFs are used
#        Enhancements for sensitivity tests.
#            Depth-in-Struc is set to Null when the structure is not exposed (versus -9999)
#            Added attribute "GridName" which specifies the gridname with each record.
#                Useful for multiple result files withappend/summary stats.
#                Results geodatabase has a time stamp embedded at the end of its name "-HHMM" (hour/minute).
#        Direct Economic Loss support added:
#            Time to full functionality - a Minimum and Maximum value (in days) are provided.
#    20171215 v3.2
#        Attribute name updates to conform to Hazus naming standards in anticipation of formal publication.
#        Added a flood depth grid attribute. Appears redundant, but useful when merging multiple
#            flood depth grids and performing pivot tables/summaries.
#        Added ContentCostUSD InventoryCostUSD output attributes.
#        Released as part of DOGAMI Open-File Report O-18-04.
